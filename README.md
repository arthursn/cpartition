# cpartition

Personal library for modeling carbon redistribution by numerically solving Fick's laws of diffusion using the Finite Differences Method algorithm.
Supports modeling fixed and mobile fcc/bcc interfaces. 

Different boundary conditions can be set depending on the taste of the user. The mixed-mode model is particularly useful for simulating scenarios where interface migration is not fully controlled by carbon diffusion.

Examples or use are simulation of kinetics of carbon redistribution during heat treatments, such as carburizing and the Quenching and Partitioning process.
