# cpartition

Personal library for modelling carbon redistribution by numerically solving Fick's second law of diffusion.
Supports modelling fixed and mobile fcc/bcc interfaces. 

Different boundary conditions can be set depending on the taste of the user. The mixed-mode model is particularly usefeul for simulating scenarios where interface migration is not fully controled by carbon diffusion.

Examples or use are simulation of kinetics of carbon redistribution during heat treatments, such as cementation and the Quenching and Partitioning process.
